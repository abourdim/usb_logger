## 🧰 What You Need

### 🔧 Hardware
- 1️⃣ BBC micro:bit (v1 or v2)
- 🔌 USB cable (to connect micro:bit to computer)

### 💻 Software
- 🌐 Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge browser
- 📶 Internet connection (to open MakeCode)

---

## 🚀 Setup Steps

### 📝 Step 1: Open MakeCode

1. 🌐 Open your web browser (Chrome or Edge)
2. 🔗 Go to: **https://makecode.microbit.org**
3. ➕ Click **"New Project"**
4. ✏️ Give it a name like "Serial Echo"

### 💻 Step 2: Switch to JavaScript Mode

1. 👀 Look at the top of the screen
2. 🖱️ Click on **"JavaScript"** (not Blocks!)

### 📋 Step 3: Copy the Code

1. 🗑️ Delete everything in the code area
2. 📋 Copy this code and paste it:

```typescript
/**
 * micro:bit Serial Echo
 * Echoes received messages over USB serial with ">" prefix
 */

// Configure serial buffers
serial.redirectToUSB()
serial.setRxBufferSize(200)
serial.setTxBufferSize(200)

// Echo handler
serial.onDataReceived(serial.delimiters(Delimiters.NewLine), function () {
    let message = serial.readUntil(serial.delimiters(Delimiters.NewLine))
    serial.writeString(">" + message.trim() + "\n")
})

// Ready indicator
basic.showIcon(IconNames.Yes)
```

### 📥 Step 4: Download to micro:bit

1. 🔌 Connect your micro:bit to your computer with the USB cable
2. ⬇️ Click the **"Download"** button (bottom left)
3. 📁 A file will download (something like `microbit-serial-echo.hex`)
4. 🖱️ Drag this file to your micro:bit drive (it shows up like a USB stick)
5. ⏳ Wait for the yellow light to stop flashing
6. ✅ You should see a **checkmark** on the micro:bit screen!

### 🌐 Step 5: Open the Web App

1. 📂 Open the file `index.html` in Chrome or Edge
2. 👀 You should see the "micro:bit Serial Logger" page

### 🔗 Step 6: Connect!

1. 🖱️ Click the **"Connect"** button
2. 📋 A popup will appear - select your micro:bit
3. ✅ Click **"Connect"** in the popup
4. 🟢 The status should change to **"Connected"** (green)

## 🎯 How to Use It

### 💬 Send a Message

1. ⌨️ Type something in the text box (like "hello")
2. ⏎ Press **Enter** or click **"Send"**
3. 👀 Watch the log - you'll see:
   - `→ hello` (what you sent) 📤
   - `← >hello` (what came back) 📥

### 🏎️ Run a Speed Test

1. 🖱️ Click the **"Test 0..1000"** button
2. 👀 Watch the messages fly by! 🚀
3. 📊 At the end, you'll see statistics:
   - ⚡ How fast it went (bytes per second)
   - 🔄 How many retries were needed
   - ✅ Success rate

### 🎛️ Other Buttons

| Button | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| 🧹 Clear | Erases all messages in the log |
| 📋 Copy | Copies all messages to clipboard |
| 💾 Export | Downloads messages as a text file |
| ⛔ Disconnect | Disconnects from micro:bit |

---

## 📊 Understanding the Statistics

After running tests, you'll see stats like this:

```
════════════════════════════════════════
TEST #1 COMPLETE ✅
────────────────────────────────────────
  Chunks: 49 | Retries: 15 | Max retry: 3 | Success: 76.6%
  Time: 2.45s | Speed: 1181.2 B/s
════════════════════════════════════════
CUMULATIVE STATS (1 tests) 📈
────────────────────────────────────────
  Total: 2894 bytes | 49 chunks | 15 retries
  Success rate: 76.6%
  Speed: min=1181 avg=1181 max=1181 B/s
  Retries/test: min=15 avg=15.0 max=15
  Max retries for single chunk: 3
  Total time: 2.45s
════════════════════════════════════════
```

### 🤓 What Does It Mean?

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 📦 **Chunks** | Big messages are split into small pieces called chunks |
| 🔄 **Retries** | Sometimes a chunk doesn't send correctly, so we try again |
| ✅ **Success rate** | How often chunks worked on the first try |
| ⚡ **Speed** | How many letters per second we can send (B/s = bytes per second) |
| 🔁 **Max retry** | The most times we had to retry a single chunk |

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### 😕 "I can't see my micro:bit in the popup"

- 🔌 Make sure the USB cable is connected
- 🔄 Try a different USB port
- ✅ Make sure you downloaded the code to the micro:bit

### 😐 "It says Connected but nothing happens"

- 🔄 Try clicking Disconnect, then Connect again
- 🔃 Refresh the web page and try again
- ⬇️ Re-download the code to the micro:bit

### 😫 "The test keeps failing"

- 👍 This is normal! The USB connection isn't perfect
- 🔄 The app will retry automatically
- 🔌 If it fails too much, try disconnecting and reconnecting

### 🤨 "I don't see the checkmark on micro:bit"

- ❌ The code didn't download properly
- ⬇️ Try downloading again
- ✅ Make sure you're using MakeCode (not Python editor)

## 🧠 How It Works (Simple Explanation)

1. ⌨️ **You type a message** → The web app sends it through the USB cable
2. 📥 **micro:bit receives it** → It adds a ">" at the start and sends it back
3. 📤 **Web app receives the reply** → It shows both messages in the log

For long messages:
- ✂️ The message is cut into small pieces (chunks)
- 1️⃣ Each chunk is sent one at a time
- ⏳ We wait for the micro:bit to reply before sending the next one
- 🔄 If something goes wrong, we try again!

---

## 🎉 Fun Things to Try

1. 👋 **Send your name** and watch it echo back!
2. 📊 **Run multiple tests** and watch the cumulative stats grow
3. 🔢 **Try sending a really long message** (type lots of numbers with no spaces)
4. 🏁 **Race with a friend** - who gets higher speed? 🏆
